          If the total thyroxine levels are above the normal range, it may be
          indicative of hyperthyroidism. Certain conditions such as Graveâ€™s
          disease (an immune system disorder which results in the overproduction
          of thyroid hormones), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland),
          toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid cancer, etc. may also be
          responsible for the increased levels of total thyroxine hormone in the
          blood.

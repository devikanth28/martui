                If the total thyroxine levels are above the normal range, it may be
                indicative of hyperthyroidism. Certain conditions such as Grave’s
                disease (an immune system disorder which results in the overproduction
                of thyroid hormones), thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland),
                toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid cancer, etc. may also be
                responsible for the increased levels of total thyroxine hormone in the
                blood.If the total thyroxine levels are above the normal range, it may be

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
